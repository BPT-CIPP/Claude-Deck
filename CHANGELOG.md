# Changelog

What changed in each version of Claude Deck. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features,
PATCH for fixes. Each version's section becomes the notes of its GitHub release (see
[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning-and-releases)).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- An effort selector in a chat's header. It changes the effort Claude uses from its next step
  on, and Default goes back to the model's own default.

### Changed
- The chat header now has two rows. The first shows the folder, session ID, prompt count and
  estimated cost, and the second holds the model, effort and permission mode.
- Long folder paths are cut from the start rather than the end, so the folder's own name stays
  visible.

### Fixed
- The model picker in the header no longer draws a box inside its box.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- Releases: each version merged to `main` is tagged `vX.Y.Z` and published as a GitHub release
  with its notes from this file.
- This changelog.
- Preferences shows which version of Claude Deck is running, with a link to the release notes.
- `npm run verify` checks that this changelog has a section for the version in `package.json`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- In a chat's reply box, ↑ takes queued messages back out of Claude's queue to edit, images
  included; with nothing queued it recalls your earlier messages (↓ steps forward again).

### Fixed
- The test stand-in for Claude Code could ignore an interrupt sent together with its message,
  which made the interrupt tests fail intermittently.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added
- First release: in-app chats and Windows Terminal sessions on one board, focus view, history
  with resume, fork and delete, a change timeline with restore and undo, live subagent details,
  plan usage, a Claude Code settings editor, themes, keyboard shortcuts, and the team workflow
  (verify gate, Stop hook, GitHub Actions checks, sandbox).
